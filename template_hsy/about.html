                    Biostatistics is the application of statistics to a wide range of topics in biology.
                    The science of biostatistics encompasses the design of biological experiments,
                    especially in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and fishery; the collection, summarization,
                    and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results.
                    A major branch of this is medical biostatistics, which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health.
